Prompt Engineering with LangChain and Hugging Face
This project demonstrates how to use LangChain for prompt engineering, combined with the Hugging Face Inference API, to build and test various NLP tasks. It showcases how structured prompts can improve the performance and clarity of LLM outputs.

üîç Project Overview
The notebook includes three main examples of prompt engineering:

Financial Advisor Prompt
Uses a custom prompt to generate beginner-friendly explanations of financial concepts, such as income tax.

Language Translation Prompt
Translates a given sentence into a target language using a simple templated prompt.

Few-Shot Antonym Prediction
Demonstrates a few-shot learning approach by providing a model with a few examples of antonyms, then prompting it to predict the antonym of a new word.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
LangChain for building structured and few-shot prompts

Hugging Face Inference API for interacting with the zephyr-7b-beta LLM

Python standard libraries (os, requests)


üìå Notes
Make sure you have access to the Hugging Face zephyr-7b-beta model.

This project is focused on prompt design, not fine-tuning or training models.

All responses depend on the quality of prompt engineering and the underlying model behavior.
