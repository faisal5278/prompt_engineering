Prompt Engineering with LangChain and Hugging Face
This project explores prompt engineering using LangChain alongside the Hugging Face Inference API. It demonstrates how structured and few-shot prompting techniques can guide a large language model to perform specific tasks more effectively.

Project Overview
The notebook includes three main examples:

Financial Advisor Prompt
Generates simplified explanations of financial concepts like income tax using a templated prompt.

Language Translation Prompt
Translates a given English sentence into a target language through a customizable prompt structure.

Few-Shot Antonym Prediction
Uses a few-shot prompt with examples to generate antonyms for input words.

Technologies Used
LangChain for prompt construction and formatting

Hugging Face Inference API (zephyr-7b-beta model) for LLM responses

Python standard libraries (os, requests)



Notes
You need access to the Hugging Face model HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta.

The project focuses on prompt engineering concepts, not model training or deployment.

Model output may vary depending on the prompt structure and wording.
